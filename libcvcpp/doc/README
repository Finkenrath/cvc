'libcvcpp' is a C++ addon written by Bartosz Kostrzewa for the CVC contraction
code by Marcus Petschlies. 

An attempt was made to provide the concepts of 'quark flavour', 'meson',
'correlator' and similar ideas in an object-oriented manner, striking
some balance between eventual ease of use, performance and reuse of
existing code.

As such, all 'raw data' is kept in the same kinds of data structures
that CVC uses (arrays of doubles), but standard library containers
are used at higher levels.

The 'test_libcvcpp.cpp' can serve as a demonstration of what the addon
was supposed to achieve. The most important changes at the user level
are an extended input file format which allows for run-time definition
of workloads in a way which may be considered more natural compared
to the many similarly named parameters used in the input file up to now.

New data structures (empty at program start) have been added: g_flavours
and g_flavour_combinations. During input file parsing these are populated
with place-holder objects which have the correct parameters and during
program initialisation (see 'test_libcvcpp.cpp'), memory is allocated
and the parameters are used to initialise the data structures.
